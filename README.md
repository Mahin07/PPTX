# 📌 Why China Should Invest in Bangladesh: The Next Asian Tiger

## 🚀 Why This Presentation Stands Out

✅ **Advanced Business Frameworks**: Integrated use of SWOT, PESTLE, and Porter’s Five Forces tailored to Bangladesh’s investment landscape  
✅ **Comparative Analysis**: Bangladesh vs. regional competitors (India, Vietnam) in labor costs, market access, and ROI  
✅ **Sector Deep-Dives**: Covers Textiles, Digital Economy, Pharma, Renewable Energy, and Infrastructure  
✅ **Data-Backed Storytelling**: Backed by World Bank, IMF, UNCTAD, and national statistics  
✅ **Professional Design & PPTX Mastery**:  
   - Structured using consulting-style layouts  
   - Effective use of slide hierarchy, white space, and iconography  
   - Built to communicate complex ideas with clarity and precision
